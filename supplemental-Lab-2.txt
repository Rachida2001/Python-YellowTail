Hands on with file management and data manipulation
Objective: Develop a python script that will open
multiple files, read the file, manipulate the data, and
write the modified data to a separate output file.
Real World Scenario: You work for a bank that is rapidly growing and have been acquiring
many other banks on a consistent basis. The bank is 3 acquisitions away from meeting
this years fiscal goal and the fiscal year is coming to close very shortly. Part of the
process to complete acquisitions is to get inventory into the banks database.
Unfortunately not all banks use the same inventory tool and therefore the output they
provide will have inconsistent field names, inconsistent value lengths, etc. Fortunately the
one consistency is that all the files the acquired banks provide are CSV files. You have
been tasked by your manager to consolidate these inventory reports into one single report
so that you can load the data into the banks inventory database.
Issues with inconsistent data: IP address field names are
different, length of data, some IP address values have
CIDR notation and some do not.
• Load inventory reports provided by the different acquired banks.
• Open the CSV files
• Read the content of the files
• Manipulate the data to be uniformed and structured to the enterprise bank
database
• Write the new results to an output file
Tasks to script:
Inventory CSVs
Inventory
Download inventory CSVs from Yellowtail Portal
yellowtail_fcu.csv
yellowtail_financial_services.csv
yellowtail_national_bank.csv
Import os and csv (built-in libraries)
Breaking down the solution...
#!/usr/bin/python
Import os
Import csv
os will allow us to work with directory structure and files. csv will help simplify reading and writing a csv formatted
file.
Create a mapping with dictionary to standardize field names.
# Keys are the standardized field name to be used in consolidated inventory
# Values are the various field names found in the different inventory CSV profided by the acquired banks
standardized_heaeder_mapping = {'Host Name' : ['Host Name', 'hostname', 'Name', 'Host'],
'IP Address' : ['IP Address', 'IP', 'IPAddress'],
'Department' : ['Department', 'Dept'],
'OS' : ['OS', 'Operating System'],
'Function' : ['Function']}
Keys in this dictionary will be the standardized field name we will want to use for the final inventory CSV.
